# Flashlight-
A simple flashlight app for Android 

I wrote this because a wanted a simple app to use the camera LED on my phone as a flashlight, without a lot of bells 
and whistles, and without needing Internet access, display ads, etc.

So there it is.  Just like a real flashlight, the entire UI consists of a single button.  Pressing it will turn the 
light on and off.
